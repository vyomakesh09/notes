To manage installations, updates, and configurations purely from the command line interface (CLI) in Linux, you can use a combination of package management commands, manual file editing, and system utility commands. Below are the steps to perform common tasks entirely from the CLI:

1. Update Package Lists
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
2. Upgrade Installed Packages
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get upgrade
3. Search for Packages
bash
Copy code
apt search [package-name]
4. Install a Package
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install [package-name]
5. Remove a Package
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get remove [package-name]
To remove the package along with its configuration files:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get purge [package-name]
6. List Installed Packages
bash
Copy code
apt list --installed
7. Check Service Status
bash
Copy code
systemctl status [service-name]
8. Start/Stop/Restart a Service
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start [service-name]
sudo systemctl stop [service-name]
sudo systemctl restart [service-name]
9. Enable/Disable a Service at Boot
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable [service-name]
sudo systemctl disable [service-name]
10. View Logs
bash
Copy code
journalctl -u [service-name]
To follow the latest log entries:

bash
Copy code
journalctl -f
11. Edit Configuration Files
Use nano or vim to edit configuration files:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /path/to/config-file
or

bash
Copy code
sudo vim /path/to/config-file
12. Check System Information
CPU info: lscpu
Memory info: free -m
Disk usage: df -h
Directory space usage: du -sh /path/to/directory
13. Networking Commands
Check IP address: ip addr show
Ping: ping [hostname or IP]
Check open ports: sudo netstat -tuln
14. Managing Users and Groups
Add user: sudo adduser [username]
Delete user: sudo deluser [username]
Add user to a group: sudo adduser [username] [groupname]
15. File and Directory Operations
List files: ls -lah
Copy files: cp /source/path /destination/path
Move or rename files: mv /source/path /destination/path
Delete files: rm /path/to/file
